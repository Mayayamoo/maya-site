        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I’ve always been a creature of the inter-webs, but during the pandemic, I began to approach it through a different lens, not just as a tool for information or a source of entertainment, but as a predictive tool for culture, politics and economics. I’ve made it my mission to harness this tool</p>
        <p><br>My first experiment was Progress Libs, a grass-roots political start-up with the goal of harnessing digital tools for political ends- a strategy that is now commonplace but at the time had me laughed out of conference rooms. This was an extremely successful venture leading to some of the largest canvassing operations in the election cycles we were involved in and at less than a fifth of the price.</p>
        <p><br>But honestly, at this point politics bore me, the incentive structures are in no way condusive to effective governance, and the faux elitism is exhausting.</p>
        <p><br>I now spend my time consulting on campaigns, tinkering with various projects, and pondering the future of this planet and how we can work together to achieve a future worthy of the human race.</p>
        <p><br>Hobbies include arguing with strangers on the internet, television and film, discussing housing policy, playing League of Legends (only when I am depressed and/or angry) cooking, playing the piano, and trying to solve all of the worlds problem with just my brain (suggestions are welcome).</p>
        <p><br>My contact can be found <a href="contact.html">here</a>, but you can also just DM me on twitter</p>
